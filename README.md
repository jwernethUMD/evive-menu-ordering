## Importing the project
1. Open eclipse

## Adding JUnit for testing
* Go to module-info.java, hover over the error, and select the first quick fix “Fix project setup…”
* Alternatively, right click on the project, hover over “Build Path” and then select “Configure Build Path”
  - Go to the libraries page, and make sure that Modulepath is selected
  - Select “Add Library”, and then select “JUnit.” Click “Next” and then “Finish”
  - Click “Apply and close”

## Running the program
* Run “MenuOrdering.java” to give the program inputs from the console (also open the console for this)
* Run “OrderTests.java” to run the tests
  - If a ClassNotFoundException occurs, restart the workspace (File -> Restart)

## Alternatives
The program can run in other spaces as long as there is a place for the java files to run, and the **JUnit library** is made available to the program.
